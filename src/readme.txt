Scheduler
The purpose of this project was to build a scheduler app using JavaFX, JDBC, MYSQL server to allow a business to be able to schedule clients
regardless of location to a specific set of parameters allowing them to only allow customers to book appointments during business hours.

The program also provides reporting based on either the Customer ID or Contact ID to show upcoming appointments.

It also provides a method to track the number and type of appointments within the months.


Built on the following technologies:

Intellij:
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.3.1

JDK:
openjdk-17.02

JavaFX version:
javafx-sdk-17.0.2\lib

JDBC connector:
mysql-connector-java-8.0.27.jar

MYSQL workbench:
8.0 CE

Running the program:
The opening screen will be the Login page, a correct username and password must be entered for testing purposes you may use username test, and password test.
From the login page you will be presented with the schedule page.

The schedule page provides the core of the functionality to navigate the system, from here you can sort appointments by all with overview, Month, Week.
You may press the Reports button to see appointments by contact, customer or a count of all appointments in a month sorted by type.
You may press the add button to add appointments, update to update appointments, delete to delete appointments.
The custom screen I added for reporting was the customer schedule allowing the user to see all appointments involving a specific customer.
You may press the customer button to see all customer information.
Within the customer screen you can add/modify/update any customer.
You may also press cancel to remove selections.

Within any sub-screen you may at any time press back to return to the Schedule page.
